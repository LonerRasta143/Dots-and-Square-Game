    <h1>Dots and Square</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Dots and Square!<br>
        The game where the goal is to claim the most squares<br>
        by completing the last connection to a square.</h2>
    <h3>How to play!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You start with a grid of evenly spaced dots.</li>
        <li>Players take turns drawing one straight line between two neighboring dots<br>
            (horizontal or vertical only) by clicking between the two dots you wish to connect.</li>
        <li>When you draw the fourth side of a box, you claim that square...<br>
            usually by writing your initial inside it.</li>
        <li>If you complete a square, you get another turn.</li>
        <li>The game ends when all possible lines are drawn.</li>
        <li>The player with the most squares wins.</li>
    </ol>
