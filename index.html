    <h1> Dots and Square</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Dots and Square The game where the goal is to claim the most squares by completing the last
        connection to a square.</h2>
    <h3>How to play!
        <ol>
            <li>You start with a grid of evenly spaced dots (for example, 4×4 dots).</li>

            <li>Players take turns drawing one straight line between two neighboring dots (horizontal or vertical only).
            </li>

            <li>When you draw the fourth side of a box, you claim that square...usually by writing your initial inside
                it.</li>

            <li>If you complete a square, you get another turn.</li>

            <li>The game ends when all possible lines are drawn.</li>

            <li>The player with the most squares wins.</li>
        </ol>
